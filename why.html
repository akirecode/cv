  <h1>Why am I doing this course?</h1>
  <p><strong>Why do I want to learn this skill?</strong></p>
  <p><em>As a child, I was unknowingly developing websites and learning code and
      it always has been a regret of mine that I never got to cultivate that skill.
      I want to be able to find the joy in coding and creating something of my own again
      as well as use this as a way to launch a career in the tech industry.</em></p>
  <p><strong>What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</strong></p>
  <p><em>If I learn this skill I'll be able to develop websites and change
      careers. </em></p>
  <p><strong>How will this skill change my life and my career?</strong></p>
  <p><em>It'll change my whole world. I'll earn a larger salary, hopefully gain
      more financial independence, find a stable job in a new field and be able
      to make a name for myself.</em></p>
  <p><strong>How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family, friends and coworkers?</strong></p>
  <p><em>I am doing this to earn a higher salary so that I can give my family
      the life they deserve. I want to be able to buy my own property, give my grandma her own home,
      pay off my parent's mortgage and give them and my siblings everything they could ever want.
      I want to be able to have independence, freedom to enjoy life with my friends, and establish
      meaningful relationships with future co-workers.</em></p>
  <p><strong>How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</strong></p>
  <p><em>Though it will not be the end of the world, I feel like if I don't try
      to pursue a career in this field now, I never will.</em></p>
  <p><strong>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?</strong></p>
  <p><em>It'll be the life I have always dreamed of if I can get a good job. A sky high
      apartment with city views, no need to worry about finances, making my family proud.
      I know money isn't everything, and as long as I have God, everything will be okay.
      But I want to find drive and purpose with my career and work, and I pray He will help
      navigate through this and guide me if this is the right path for me.</em></p>
